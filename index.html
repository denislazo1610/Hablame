          Hablame.com is a website where you can learn how to SPEAK a new language fluently. Other websites will teach you the grammar part of a language, but are
          you speaking it? Hablame.com is going to connect you to native speakers of your goal language.

        Connect to other culture deeply
      </h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-1">
        People would say "that as long as you have a device in your hand that can help you to translate, you will be fine." However, you are not going to acquire
        all the details from a culture. There are words that cannot be translated specifically. It is going to be hard to make new friends if you just use a device 
        to communicate with other people, it is not spontaneous! Living another culture such as reading books, talking to people in another language will foster your
        appreciation of other cultures.

        Benefits for your Future
      </h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-2">
      Domaining a new language will not only make you appreciate another culture, but it can help you in your career, find a new job, take opportunities that 
        could happen only once in a life-span. For example, what if your future spouse speaks only French? What if your future boss speaks only German? Your
        dream university is only available in Chinese? What about if you want to do a business in Russia, and you know it is going to make a lot of profit, but
        you do not speak Russian?. See? Domaining a language can help you to get in to your dream university, get your dream job, make your business possible and, 
        if you are lucky, find your love waiting for you on the other side of the world.
